# path-finding-in-maze

Solving a maze using an informed search algorithm.
Here, A* star Search is used to find an optimal path from A to B.
I have used Tkinter as an external module to demonstrate the working in a window.

Step 1: First run the window.py file, a window will pop up with a yellow colored upload button. Upload a .txt file containing the design of the maze.


Step 2: A colored image of the maze will appear in the same window. Below it will be a 'Show solution' button.
        On clicking it the A* algorithm will find the optimal path.



Step 3: Our maze is solved and the path will be colored as green.
        You can view more details like, How many states does it explore? or What are the states in the maze in which we found a solution?
